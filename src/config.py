"""
Configuration module for OpenGlassBox simulation engine.

This module defines global configuration constants used throughout the simulation,
equivalent to the C++ config namespace.
"""

# Grid size constant - equivalent to C++ config::GRID_SIZE
GRID_SIZE = 1.0

# Other configuration constants can be added here as needed
# For example:
# TICKS_PER_SECOND = 60
# MAX_RESOURCE_CAPACITY = 2147483647
