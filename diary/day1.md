**Migration will follow a "tests first" approach:**
For each module, port the C++ test file to Python first, then implement only enough of the Python module to make the test pass. This ensures correctness and incremental progress.

This document provides a comprehensive, actionable plan for porting the OpenGlassBox simulation engine from C++ to Python, integrating best practices from both traditional and test-driven development (TDD) approaches.

---

## 1. Preparation & Scoping

- **Understand the Codebase:** Review C++ classes, relationships, and simulation flow.
- **Identify Core Modules:** List all major components (Agent, City, Unit, Map, Resource, Rule, Simulation, etc.).
- **Set Up Python Environment:** Create a `python/` directory, initialize a virtual environment, and decide on a test framework (e.g., `pytest`).
- **Leverage Python Ecosystem:** Plan to use `dataclasses`, `typing`, `pytest`, and other modern Python tools.

## 3. Test-First, Iterative Porting Workflow

For each component (e.g., Agent), follow this detailed process:

### a. Port the Test

- **Translate the C++ test file** (e.g., `TestsAgent.cpp`) to Python (`test_agent.py`).
  - Map C++ test macros (e.g., `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_STREQ`) to Python's `unittest` or `pytest` assertions.
  - If the Python class does not exist yet, create stubs or mocks so the test can be written and run first.
- **Tips:**
  - Use `@unittest.skip` or `pytest.mark.skip` for incomplete tests.
  - Write docstrings for each test to clarify intent.

### b. Port the Implementation

- **Translate the C++ class** (e.g., `Agent`) to Python (`agent.py`).
  - Use Python idioms: classes, `@dataclass` for simple data holders, `list`/`dict` for containers.
  - Implement only enough to make the test pass.
- **Tips:**
  - Use type hints for clarity.
  - Document class and methods with docstrings.

### c. Run and Refine

- **Run the test** with `pytest` or `python -m unittest`.
  - Fix any issues in the implementation or test until the test passes.
  - Refactor for clarity and Pythonic style as you go.
- **Tips:**
  - Use code coverage tools (`pytest --cov`) to ensure all logic is tested.
  - Commit frequently to track progress and enable easy rollbacks.

### d. Repeat

- **Move to the next component** and repeat steps aâ€“c.
  - Port the next test and its corresponding implementation.
  - Maintain a steady, incremental pace for reliability and maintainability.
